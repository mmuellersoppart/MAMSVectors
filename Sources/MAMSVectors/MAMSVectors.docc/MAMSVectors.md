# ``MAMSVectors``

This package redefines a few Core Graphics types for SwiftUI's canvas.

## Overview

Three types are included.

* ``Point2D`` (`CGPoint`)
* ``Vector2D`` (`CGVector`)
* ``PositionalVector2D`` (a combination of `CGPoint` and `CGVector`)

Main benefits of this package are

* Basic operators are defined. e.g. `+`, `*`, `==`
* Both Imperative and Functional programming options available for many operations.
* ``Point2D`` and ``PositionalVector2D`` can draw themselves for easy debugging with the ``Drawable`` protocol. 
* Clearly laid out DocC Documentation with example use cases.
