# ``MAMSVectors``

This package redefines many of the basic Core Graphics types with more functionality out of the box.  

## Overview

Three types are included.

* ``Point2D`` (`CGPoint`)
* ``Vector2D`` (`CGVector`)
* ``PositionalVector2D`` (a combination of `CGPoint` and `CGVector`)

* Operators e.g. `+`, `*`, `==`
